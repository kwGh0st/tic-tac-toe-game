# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic-Tac-Toe" in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Swing library.

## Overview

The game allows two players to compete against each other by marking 'X' or 'O' symbols on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns using the mouse to click on specific buttons, representing the game grid, to make their moves.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Swing library.
- Players can make moves by clicking on the grid buttons.
- The game logic handles player turns and determines the winner or a draw.
- Option to restart the game after it concludes.

## Planned Enhancements

In future updates, the following enhancements are planned:
- Refactoring the code structure into multiple classes to separate game logic from the graphical interface.
- Introduction of a single-player mode allowing players to compete against an AI (artificial intelligence).
- Potential improvements to the user interface and additional features.

## How to Play
[download](https://github.com/kwGh0st/tic-tac-toe-game/raw/master/TicTacToe.jar)

1. Run the application
2. Use the mouse to click on the grid buttons to make your move.
3. Alternate turns with the other player.
4. The game ends when a player achieves a winning pattern or if the grid is filled without a winner (draw).
5. After a game concludes, players have the option to restart and play again.

## Structure of the Project

The code structure currently resides in a single class that combines both the graphical interface and game logic. Planned refactoring will involve separating these functionalities into distinct classes for better code organization.
